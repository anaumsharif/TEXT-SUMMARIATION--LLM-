Text Summarization is an advanced method of condensing large bodies of text into concise summaries by employing LLM (Large Language Model) technology.
This approach revolutionizes the process of digesting and extracting key information from lengthy documents or articles.
With this model  users can input extensive text passages or documents, and the LLM model processes this information to produce a succinct summary.
By understanding the context and nuances of the text, LLM generates summaries that capture the essential points while preserving the original meaning and coherence.
This tool offers numerous benefits, including time efficiency, as it drastically reduces the time required to extract vital information from lengthy documents.
